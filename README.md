# cephus-contact-list
In this Repo we are Mapping through some json Data provided by our instructor.

We Used Create React App to make this Contact List: 
  <ul>Contact Card Must include:</ul>
  <li>Image</li>
  <li>Name (first & second)</li>
  <li>Home Phone</li>
  <li>Cell Phone</li>
  <br>
  ___________________
  
  <ul>üó∫Ô∏è Methods used were the .map() prototype combined with destructuring of json data and usage of <strong>REACT PROPS</strong></ul>
  <h1>CONTACT LIST SCREENGRAB</h1>
  <p>I did some light styling and edited the flex to scroll up and down</p>
